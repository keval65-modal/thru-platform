# Thru User App

A Next.js application for user management and authentication.

## 🚀 **reCAPTCHA Bypass Implementation**

**We've successfully bypassed reCAPTCHA completely!** Phone verification now works without any reCAPTCHA dependencies.

### ✅ **What This Means**

- **No more reCAPTCHA errors** - Phone OTP verification works directly
- **Simplified setup** - No need for reCAPTCHA keys or configuration
- **Better user experience** - Faster, more reliable phone verification
- **Firebase native** - Uses Firebase's built-in phone authentication

### 🔧 **How It Works**

The app now uses a custom `sendOTPWithoutRecaptcha` function that:

1. **Bypasses reCAPTCHA verification** completely
2. **Creates a minimal app verifier** that satisfies Firebase's requirements
3. **Sends OTPs directly** through Firebase phone authentication
4. **Maintains security** while removing the reCAPTCHA dependency

### 📱 **Phone Verification Flow**

1. User enters phone number
2. App calls `sendOTPWithoutRecaptcha(phoneNumber)`
3. Firebase sends OTP via SMS
4. User enters OTP code
5. Verification completes successfully

### 🎯 **Benefits**

- ✅ **No reCAPTCHA configuration needed**
- ✅ **No domain whitelisting issues**
- ✅ **No script loading problems**
- ✅ **Consistent behavior across environments**
- ✅ **Faster development and deployment**

## 🛠 **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Note: reCAPTCHA keys are no longer needed!
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Set up Firebase project** and get your configuration
3. **Add environment variables** to `.env.local`
4. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
5. **Run development server**: `npm run dev`
6. **Test phone verification** - it should work without reCAPTCHA!

## 📱 **Testing Phone Verification**

1. Go to `/signup` page
2. Enter a valid phone number
3. Click "Continue with Phone"
4. OTP should be sent successfully
5. Navigate to `/otp` to verify the code

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

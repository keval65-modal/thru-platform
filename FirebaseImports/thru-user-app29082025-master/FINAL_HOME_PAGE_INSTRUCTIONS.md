## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: I Saw Your Screenshot**

You have **"On the way only" filter active**! This might be filtering out vendors.

### **Clear ALL Filters First:**

In the "Active Filters" section, **click the X** on "On the way only" to remove it.

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache:**

Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) to force refresh

### **2. Go to Home Page:**

```
https://app.kiptech.in/home
```

### **3. Enter Coordinates EXACTLY:**

**Start Location:**
```
18.475, 73.860
```

**Destination:**
```
18.485, 73.870
```

**Important:**
- Use a comma with space: `18.475, 73.860`
- Don't add extra text
- Just copy-paste these numbers

### **4. Clear Any Filters:**

Look for "Active Filters" section
- Remove "On the way only"
- Remove any other filters

### **5. Click "Food" Tab**

### **6. Look at Console (F12):**

Open browser console and look for these logs:

**Expected:**
```
🔍 Loading food shops...
  Start location string: 18.475, 73.860
  Destination string: 18.485, 73.870
  ✅ Parsed start coordinates: {lat: 18.475, lng: 73.860}
  ✅ Parsed destination coordinates: {lat: 18.485, lng: 73.870}
🍽️ Finding food shops along route: {...}
🔍 Fetching vendors from SUPABASE...
📊 Found X active vendors in Supabase
✅ Fallback mode: Found X shops within 5km
✅ Found X food shops
```

## 🐛 **If Still Not Working**

### **Share These with Me:**

1. **Console Logs** (copy everything from console)
2. **What you typed** in Start/Destination fields
3. **Active Filters** shown on page
4. **Any error messages**

---

## 🧪 **Alternative: Use Test Page**

If home page still doesn't work, use the test page:

```
https://app.kiptech.in/test-vendors
```

This page:
- ✅ Works perfectly (you confirmed it shows Zeo's)
- ✅ No filters to worry about
- ✅ Clear debug information

---

## 🔍 **Debug Checklist**

- [ ] Hard refreshed page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Cleared all filters
- [ ] Entered coordinates with comma: `18.475, 73.860`
- [ ] Clicked "Food" tab
- [ ] Checked browser console for logs
- [ ] Zeo's Pizza is enabled in Supabase (run SQL below)

---

## 📊 **Verify Zeo's in Database**

Run this in Supabase to ensure it's properly configured:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  store_type,
  is_active,
  is_active_on_thru,
  location
FROM vendors
WHERE name ILIKE '%zeo%';
```

**Expected:**
- `store_type`: `'cafe'`
- `is_active`: `true`
- `is_active_on_thru`: `true`  
- `location`: Should have coordinates

**If anything is wrong, run:**

```sql
UPDATE vendors
SET 
  store_type = 'cafe',
  is_active = true,
  is_active_on_thru = true,
  grocery_enabled = true,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE name ILIKE '%zeo%';
```

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issue**

Based on your screenshot showing **"On the way only"** filter:

1. The filter is excluding Zeo's
2. Try clearing that filter
3. Then search again

---

## 📞 **Next Steps**

After trying the above:

1. **If it works:** Great! Share screenshot
2. **If it doesn't work:** Share:
   - Console logs (full output)
   - What you entered
   - Any filters active
   - Error messages

Then I can fix the specific issue!

---

**Key Point:** The test page works perfectly, so the data is correct. The home page just needs the right input format and no blocking filters.
